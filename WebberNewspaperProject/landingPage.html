            <h2>Japanese Scientists Create Saltwater Biodegradable Plastic</h2>
                <p>Saltwater biodegradable plastic developed by RIKEN scientists dissolves completely in seawater after 8.5 hours, offering a promising solution to the global microplastic pollution crisis affecting oceans worldwide.</p>        
                <p>Scientists at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science in Japan have developed a saltwater biodegradable plastic that completely dissolves when soaked in seawater. This innovation could help address the growing global crisis of microplastic pollution that now affects every corner of our planet.</p>
                <p>Microplastics—plastic fragments smaller than 5mm—have infiltrated remote regions of the deep ocean, the Arctic, and even the air we breathe. These tiny particles are increasingly found in human bodies, particularly the blood and brain. While researchers are still studying their full impact, microplastics are known to cause significant problems in marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
